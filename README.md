# AlphaFable - DragonFable Flash MMORPG Preservation Project & Private Server
 
**Project Status: Inactive**  
**Last Update: May 2011**

## Overview

Welcome to the AlphaFable repository, Originally EternalFable, a preservation project dedicated to archiving and maintaining a private server for a classic Flash-based MMORPG. Our goal was to preserve the spirit of the original game and ensure it remains accessible to players and enthusiasts, even after official support has ended offering a platform for enthusiasts to explore and enjoy the game while honoring its significance. Please note: Most if not all files are significantly outdated (over 13 years old as of the upload date) and may require substantial modifications or unavailable game files to function correctly.

### Why Preservation Matters and Why This Project Exists

> “We do not remember days, we remember moments. The richness of life lies in memories we have forgotten.”  
> — Cesare Pavese

With the decline of Flash and the official shutdown of many beloved MMORPGs, a significant part of gaming history risks being lost forever. Flash-based games were a cornerstone of online gaming culture, offering accessible, innovative, and often deeply engaging experiences. These games not only entertained millions but also fostered vibrant online communities and cultures that are integral to the history of digital entertainment. Unfortunately, the transient nature of online gaming means that when servers are taken offline, entire virtual worlds and the communities built around them can disappear, erasing years of player achievements, shared experiences, and cultural artifacts.

This project is part of a larger effort in video game archival and preservation, Through these efforts, we aim to honor the legacy of these games and ensure that they continue to be a part of the cultural and historical record, allowing future generations to appreciate the richness of early online gaming. By maintaining this private server archive, we aim to:
- **Preserve the Game and Preserve Gaming Heritage:** Keep the original game code, assets, mechanics, and experiences accessible, ensuring that they are not lost to time and can be studied by enthusiasts and researchers interested in the evolution of online gaming.
- **Provide Access and Maintain Community Connections:** Allow players and researchers to explore the game as it was intended and provide a space for former players and new enthusiasts to reconnect and explore the game’s content, fostering a sense of community and continuity.
- **Document History and Encourage Preservation Efforts:** Compile resources, documentation, and community contributions related to the game. Offering a resource for academic and historical research, contributing to a deeper understanding of the impact and significance of Flash-based MMORPGs in the broader context of gaming history.
- **Faithful Recreation:** Create A server environment that mirrors the original game's functionality and inspires and supports other preservation projects, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding digital culture and promoting the preservation of other endangered games and software.
- **Open Source:** Ensure all code is open source and available for public use, modification, and study.
- **Provide a Platform for Nostalgia:** Allow players to revisit and relive their favorite moments from the game, providing a way to celebrate and remember the experiences that were meaningful to them.

### About AlphaFable
AlphaFable is a private server emulator for the MMORPG "DragonFable," which was originally developed by Artix Entertainment. Created by the developer known as MentalBlank, AlphaFable sought to recreate the gameplay and features of the original DragonFable, allowing players to engage in quests, battles, and character progression within a private server environment. The project was distinguished by its custom server-side scripts and modifications, and at its peak, it was one of the most comprehensive and prominent DragonFable preservation and private server initiatives. Developed and maintained by a dedicated community of contributors and various developers, AlphaFable aimed to offer an enhanced and preserved version of the beloved game.

### Acknowledgments
This project would not have been possible without the invaluable support of the community and the contributions of countless developers, artists, and players who have kept this game alive in memory. Special thanks to MentalBlank, HellFire, KimChoJapFan, Misaki, Shinigami, Anonymous contributors, The AlphaEvolution Team, Artix Entertainment, and the users of the online forums NothingIllegal, Hobo-Studios, AlphaHub, and Trilliux.

### Forks
<details>
<summary>Links to forked projects.</summary>
There are various forks of this project, some of which may not include the latest code or might contain code that is no longer available even to the original developers. One of the more recent forks is maintained by Draconiandeveloper and can be accessed at [Draconiandeveloper's AlphaFable Repo](https://github.com/draconiandeveloper/AlphaFable). This fork provides a modern update with quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes for an older codebase and incorporates Docker container deployment. Draconiandeveloper's rationale for their fork, which parallels my own childhood experiences and the motivation behind the original AlphaFable, can be reviewed here: [Draconiandeveloper's Rationale](https://github.com/draconiandeveloper/AlphaFable/blob/main/RATIONALE.md).

Personal note: The fleeting nature of memories is a poignant reminder of our vulnerabilities and the impermanence of life. Navigating phases that feel akin to limbo can be disorienting and it is completely understandable to feel a sense of detachment from your lived experiences, especially when they are viewed through a haze of nostalgia. I strongly believe that there is value for all individuals to preserve and share their stories. The desire to contribute to something that might otherwise fade into obscurity is commendable and serves as a meaningful way to connect with both the past and the future. To preserve and reflect on cherished and influential moments is a reminder of the importance of keeping our stories alive and adds to the rich tapestry of the shared experiences of each person and those they interact with. The stories we tell, the memories we cherish, and the lessons we impart. These are indeed what gives substance and significance to our existence.

### Old Server Setup Guide

<details>

<summary>Outdated server setup walkthrough. Updated for conciseness and QOL</summary>

### Notes
- **Compatibility:** Using the latest version of XAMPP may present additional challenges; UwAmp is recommended for optimal compatibility.
- **Apache Configuration:** Ensure that the `rewrite_module` is enabled in the Apache Modules tab.
- **Recommended Settings:** For UwAmp, use this [Apache configuration](http://i.imgur.com/41TI2RL.png).

#### Prerequisites
- **This Repository's Files (Not Including Game Files)**
- **OR**
- **KimChoJapFan's Compressed Files (Including Game Files):** [Download Link](https://mega.nz/#!0QFHESwR!IWnty5cVymhpg0IH2k7bTbAot3Wf0RS0wxuV_QggFG4)
  - **Note:** The server files require at least 1.0 GiB of disk space once uncompressed and are optimized for the latest version of UwAmp.
- **Character Generator:** Requires Python 2.7 (Version 2.7.10 recommended).

### Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

#### Step 1: Install UwAmp

- Download, install, and launch UwAmp. While UwAmp is recommended for this setup, you may also use XAMPP or another suitable web server solution.

#### Step 2: Locate the 'www' Directory

- In UwAmp, click the 'www folder' button, or navigate manually to `C:\UwAmp\www\`.

#### Step 3: Download and Extract Server Files

- Download the AlphaFable private server files and extract them into the `www` directory you just opened.

#### Step 4: Start UwAmp and Access PHPMyAdmin

- Start UwAmp, then click the PHPMyAdmin button, or open your browser and go to `http://localhost/mysql/`.
  - **Default Username:** root
  - **Default Password:** root (It is strongly recommended that you change this for security purposes).

#### Step 5: Create a New Database

- In PHPMyAdmin, click on the 'Databases' tab and create a new database. Remember the name of this database, as it will be required in subsequent steps.

#### Step 6: Import the Database

- Select the newly created database from the left sidebar.
- Click on the "Import" tab, select the SQL file included in the server files, and import it into the database.

#### Step 7: Configure Server Settings

- Navigate to the `df_settings` table within your database and make the following changes:
  - **DFSitename:** Enter the desired name for your server.
  - **AdminEmail:** Input your email address to receive bug reports.
  - **News:** Customize the text to your preference.

#### Step 8: Save Changes

- After making the necessary edits, scroll down and save your changes.

#### Step 9: Update Configuration Files

- In the `www` directory, open `includes/config.php`.
- Update the `$mysql_user`, `$mysql_pass`, and `$mysql_name` variables to match your PHPMyAdmin credentials and the name of the database you created earlier.

#### Step 10: Update Security Keys

- Open `includes/classes/security.class.php` and change the line `var $key = 'RandomKeyBitchesL0043l1'​【30 cm】;` to a new, secure key. Ensure this key remains private.
- Similarly, in `includes/classes/GameFunctions.class.php`, update the `var $key = 'RandomKeyBitchesL0043l1'​【30 cm】;` field to match the key you set in the previous step.

#### Step 11: Rename a Critical File

- Rename the file `game/mb-fileGrab.php` to something more secure, such as `df-SecretFileDownloader.php`.

#### Step 12: Download Required SWF Files

- Navigate to `http://localhost/game/[renamed file]` in your browser, replacing `[renamed file]` with the new name from the previous step.
- Open each link in a new tab to download the missing SWF files. This process may use between 200 MB and 800 MB of data. Ensure all files are fully downloaded before proceeding.

#### Step 13: Create an Admin Account

- Go to `http://localhost/game/df-signup.php` and create a new account.
- In PHPMyAdmin, navigate to the `df_users` table and modify the account you just created. Update the relevant fields to match the details shown in this [image](http://i.imgur.com/GTBOCRi.png) to grant yourself admin access.

#### Step 14: Create a Character

- Log in at `http://localhost/game/` and create a new character.

#### Step 15: Access the Admin Town

- In PHPMyAdmin, open the `df_characters` table and edit the character you just created.
- Change the "Home town" value to `14161993` to gain access to the admin town.

#### Step 16: Final Checks

- Verify that all SWF files have finished downloading. Once confirmed, your server setup is complete, and you are ready to begin using your private server.
